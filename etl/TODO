- please include a time series for <country, year>,income_group and <country, year>,income_group_low_middle_high based on OGHIST.xls (historical income groups from wb knowledge base article).

    I guess we can add income_group_lowmiddle_high as well for completeness sake, won't be a lot of extra work.

- How were you planning to model country properties for domains that should have multiple values?

    A lower middle country would get income_group: lmy,lmc,mic?
    Same with lending category. E.g. afg is ibt,ida and idx.

- move dataponints output to a folder so that homepage won't get a lot of files.
